# Decision-Tree
Decision tree a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. In our Database management course there was an assignment to implement a decision tree. This code is the implementation of a decision tree.
